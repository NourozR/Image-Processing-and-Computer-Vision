# Image Processing and Computer Vision Practice Problems:

This repository contains codes of all my practice problems of Computer Vision and Image Processing using Python Libraries: NumPy, PIL, SciPy, OpenCV. Also, I have plans to build a complete online tutorial on "Image Processing and Computer Vision" using Python.


# 1
- image transformation
- image filtering
- image sharpening

# 2
- adding random noise
- denoising with gaussian kernel
- denoising with median kernel

# 3
- edge detection with Sobel Gradient Operator (Sobel Operator: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator )

# 4
- histogram based image segmentation
